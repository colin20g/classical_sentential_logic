# classical_sentential_logic
Proof system and propositional semantics for formulas written with or and not as logical connectors. 

This text defines a proof system for classical sentential logic with or and not as primary connectors.
Normal conjunctive and disjunctive forms are introduced and the completeness of propositional calculus
with respect to truth values is proven. Further explanations are to be found as comments in the source code.
The code is entirely self-contained.
